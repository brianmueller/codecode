# Session 3: Terminal Tricks

Before digging into some terminal tricks, it can be helpful to know how to move your away around the command line. If you haven't already tried the HW and/or feel totally lost, start [here](../README.md#suggested-hw-before-session-3-terminal-basics).

| Command | Explanation | Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `ls` | list the files/folders in the current directory | `ls`
| `cd` | "change directory" into a subdirectory or up one level to the parent directory (`..`) | `cd subdir` or `cd ..`
| `mkdir` | make a new subdirectory in the current directory | `mkdir subdir`
| `touch` | make a new file in the current directory | `touch grades.csv`
| rm -rf | delete something, including all its subdirectories and their contents | `rm -rf subdir` or `rm -rf *` to delete ALL subdirectories (be careful!!!)

## Github Classroom

Most of the tricks below are particularly helpful for grading code collected via Github Classroom. You can download students' code using:
* [Github Classroom CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/using-github-classroom-with-github-cli#clone-a-students-assignment-repository)
